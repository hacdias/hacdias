**HI 👋, I'M HENRIQUE** (he/him), a Portuguese-born 🇵🇹 being that is currently living in The Netherlands 🇳🇱. I enjoy learning about new things, taking photographs, playing badminton, and programming. I'm a recently graduated 🎓 master's student, and a software engineer 🛠 interested in web infrastructure, decentralized systems, identity, and making tools for developers and users. I like coffee ☕️ and tea 🍵 alike.
